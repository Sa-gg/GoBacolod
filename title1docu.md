# OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY

## General Objective

To design and develop an MCP-governed, AI-assisted jeepney routing and navigation system that provides intelligent route guidance, event-aware adjustments, POI recommendations, fare estimation, and moderated crowdsourced transport updates for Bacolod City.

## Specific Objectives (SMART)

1. To develop a web-based routing system that digitally maps and visualizes official jeepney routes within Bacolod City before the end of Capstone Project 2.

2. To implement an AI assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) that can:
   - Provide route directions
   - Answer location-based queries
   - Recommend nearby points of interest (POIs)
   - Estimate jeepney fares

3. To design an event overlay module that allows authorized government users to pin official events (e.g., elections, MassKara Festival, road closures) and dynamically adjust route recommendations accordingly.

4. To integrate a fare calculation system that computes estimated jeepney fares based on route distance and stored fare matrices.

5. To implement a moderated crowdsourced submission module where commuters can:
   - Suggest route corrections
   - Submit updated fare information
   - Report inaccuracies  
   All submissions must undergo administrative approval before integration.

6. To develop a transport data API that can be accessed by third-party developers for integration into other applications.

# RATIONALE

In today’s digital transportation landscape, intelligent navigation systems play a crucial role in improving commuter mobility and urban accessibility. While global platforms like :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} and :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} provide advanced routing services, they often lack localized and structured jeepney routing data tailored specifically for cities like :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Jeepneys remain one of the primary modes of public transportation in the city, yet route information is commonly informal, undocumented, or difficult for commuters and tourists to access digitally.

Currently, commuters rely on personal knowledge, word-of-mouth instructions, or static social media posts to determine jeepney routes, fare estimates, and stop locations. During major events such as the :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} or election periods where voting centers are assigned to specific schools, routes may temporarily change due to road closures or traffic regulations. However, there is no centralized, intelligent system that dynamically reflects these adjustments for commuters in real time. This results in confusion, inefficient travel planning, inaccurate fare expectations, and limited accessibility for first-time visitors.

Moreover, existing mapping platforms do not provide a structured API dedicated to jeepney routing in Bacolod City. This creates a gap for local developers who may want to build transport-related applications but lack standardized, programmatically accessible route data.

To address these challenges, there is a need for a localized, AI-powered transport intelligence platform that centralizes jeepney route data, integrates event-based adjustments, and enables moderated community participation. Technology—particularly AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP)—can provide controlled, context-aware responses by retrieving verified route, fare, and POI data from structured databases rather than relying on unverified information.

Therefore, this project proposes the development of **GoBacolod**, an MCP-governed AI-assisted jeepney routing and safe navigation system. The system will include features such as digital route mapping, fare estimation, event overlays for government use, POI recommendations with structured metadata, and a crowdsourced update mechanism with administrative validation. Additionally, it will expose a transport data API for third-party developers.

The proposed system is expected to benefit commuters, tourists, local government units, and software developers by improving route accessibility, increasing transport transparency, enabling dynamic event-based navigation, and fostering a localized transport data ecosystem for Bacolod City.
